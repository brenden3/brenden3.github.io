<hr>
<p>I think that this maybe came to be when I was just screwing around with HTML and made something I liked. Then, I built off of that and now we're here, a site that serves no purpose. Also, for all these pages, this site really doesn't have that much content. I'm still not really sure why I decided that this was something that needed to be made available to the world.</p>

<span class="title">About Me</span>
<hr>
<span class="heading">MY NAME</span>
<p>I don't like putting that out onto the interwebs, but it starts with a B.</p>
<br>
<span class="heading">MY ACHIEVEMENTS</span>
<p>I make really sketchily written HTML as a hobby, and I commit tax fraud as a job. Sure, I could spend my time better, but I could also spend it worse.</p>
